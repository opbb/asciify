# Asciify
#### Converts images, videos and GIFs into playable ASCII art that can be viewed in any major browser.

While there are many image/video to ASCII converters, I could not find one that let you asciify videos and share them in their full, text-based glory. The goal of Asciify is to allow non-technical people to easily create and share ASCII images, videos, and GIFs with other non-technical people.
To do this, Asciify generates standalone HTML files that are viewable in any major browser, and include an ASCII video player and embedded audio. All processing is done client-side both to protect user privacy and to eliminate the need for a server.



Asciify relies on [image-js](https://github.com/image-js/image-js), [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js), and [FFmpeg.WASM](https://ffmpegwasm.netlify.app/). It is styled with [Bulma](https://bulma.io/).
